# Spindrift

Created, written and developed by Matthew Romano

### Disclaimer
V1.0.0 of spin drift is going to act as a demo of sorts with an entirely text based display.
In the future I hope to add graphics and more detailed gameplay but for now the game will be coded entirely in C using no external graphics libraries.

### Description
Spindrift is a simple turn based naval combat game that allows the player to control ships, submaries, and oil rigs.
Heavily inspired by turn based combat games of old and the board game Battleship. 
Play agaisnt an AI opponenet and try to take down their ships and capture their rigs to win. 
Come along and sail the seven seas while destroying some enemy ships in the process.

### Installation Instructions

Copy the repository and run the solution in visual studio.

### Usage

As of now the game simply runs out of visual studios built in console as the game is entirely text based.
